Smart CO₂ Monitoring and Capture Simulation using MOFs
📌 Project Overview

The Smart CO₂ Monitoring and Capture Simulation using MOFs is a software-based web application designed to raise awareness about carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in different environments and to simulate how MOF-based carbon capture systems can help reduce CO₂ at scale.

This project focuses on visualization, education, and decision support, not on physical CO₂ capture or real-time sensor data.

🎯 Problem Statement

Increasing CO₂ levels are a major contributor to climate change.
However, most people:

do not understand what CO₂ levels mean,

cannot visualize the impact of carbon capture technologies,

are unaware of emerging solutions like Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs).

There is a need for a simple, transparent, and educational tool that helps users understand:

CO₂ concentration levels in different environments

the potential impact of MOF-based capture systems

💡 Solution Approach

This application provides:

predefined environmental scenarios

average CO₂ concentration values (ppm)

a simulation of MOF-based CO₂ capture using percentage efficiency

clear visual comparison of CO₂ levels before and after capture

The system is intentionally kept simple and realistic, avoiding over-engineering or false claims.

👥 Target Users

General public interested in environmental awareness

Students and educators

Institutions (schools, offices, communities) exploring sustainability concepts

⚙️ Key Features

🌍 Environment-based CO₂ selection (classroom, traffic, residential, industrial)

📊 Display of average CO₂ concentration values (ppm)

🧪 Simulation of MOF-based CO₂ capture using fixed efficiency

📉 Visual comparison of CO₂ levels before and after capture

📘 Educational explanations for every result

🧭 Application Flow

User opens the web application

Selects an environment type

System retrieves average CO₂ level

CO₂ level is displayed to the user

User initiates MOF capture simulation

📄 For detailed logic, refer to FLOW.md.

🔌 API Overview

The backend provides simple REST APIs to:

fetch base CO₂ levels for environments

simulate MOF-based CO₂ capture

expose MOF efficiency configuration

📄 Full API documentation is available in API.md.

🧪 About MOFs (Metal-Organic Frameworks)

MOFs are advanced porous materials researched for applications such as:

gas storage

gas separation

carbon capture

⚠️ Important Clarification
This project:

does NOT simulate chemical reactions

does NOT claim real-world capture

uses generalized efficiency values from literature for educational purposes

🚫 What This Project Does NOT Do

To avoid misinformation, this application:

does not capture CO₂ physically

does not use real-time sensor data

does not integrate hardware

does not model chemical processes

It is a software simulation and visualization tool only.
